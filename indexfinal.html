  <h1>💖 In Every Giggle, In Every Tear 💖</h1>
  <h2>~ A Complete Story of Us ~</h2>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h3 class="chapter-title">💖 Chapter 1: When Strangers Found Home in a “Heyy” 💖</h3>
    <p>It started with something so small — a notification, a gentle ping. Not fate, not a miracle… just a “Heyy it’s me… Chatterbox.”</p>
    <p>And there I was — a boy, unaware that this simple text would change everything.</p>
    <p>“Hey, it’s me Nishant… aka Murthy,” I typed back, smiling without knowing why. “You can call me anything you like — just don't forget me.”</p>
    <p>We didn’t know it yet, but that was the moment a new world began. A world where hearts were still learning to trust, but smiles had already found their way.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h3 class="chapter-title"> Chapter 2: The Giggles That Made Me Fall 💫</h3>
    <p>Her laugh wasn’t just a sound. It was therapy. It was magic. The kind that makes you forget everything wrong with the world.</p>
    <p>When she laughed, it felt like spring bloomed in my chest. Like the world finally had music again.</p>
    <p>At first, we’d text until our fingers hurt. But that wasn’t enough.</p>
    <p>Calls started to replace silence. And those calls — they weren’t just conversations. They were memories in the making.</p>
    <p>One day, she said, “You make me laugh like no one else does…”</p>
    <p>And in that giggle, I found something sacred. Love? Maybe not yet. But I knew — I never wanted to stop hearing her laugh.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h3 class="chapter-title"> Chapter 3: From Laughter to Love❤️</h3>
    <p>We never planned it. We didn’t even see it coming.</p>
    <p>But slowly, the “goodnights” became softer. The “are you okay?” came even when we were fine.</p>
    <p>The comfort grew. The calls became confessions.</p>
    <p>One night, under a quiet sky, we hesitated…</p>
    <p>“Do you think this is… love?”</p>
    <p>“I think it already was.”</p>
    <p>And then we said it. “I love you.”</p>
    <p>Not because we had to. But because our hearts were tired of holding it in.</p>
    <p>That moment wasn’t loud — but my entire world paused to hear it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h3 class="chapter-title"> Chapter 4: The Video Call That Changed It All❤️</h3>
    <p>Our first VC? Oh, it was adorable chaos. I was fixing my hair. She was hiding her blush behind a pillow.</p>
    <p>We barely said anything — but we didn’t need to. Our eyes spoke volumes.</p>
    <p>I was nervous. She looked like the softest dream.</p>
    <p>We kept giggling, fumbling — but something about that call changed everything.</p>
    <p>From pixels to real feelings. From voices to visions.</p>
    <p>A month later, we had another video call — this time with less awkwardness, more connection.</p>
    <p>That call didn’t just connect our devices — it connected two souls who were already in love.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h3 class="chapter-title"> Chapter 5: The Days That Weren’t Easy</h3>
    <p>We had our storms. Days when I was drowning in work. Days when she cried silently, wishing I had called.</p>
    <p>She felt like I forgot her. I felt like I failed her.</p>
    <p>But even in those quiet fights and aching silences, we never gave up.</p>
    <p>We wrote poems instead of apologies. We used love as our language.</p>
    <p>Like the time I said, “I don’t bleed but I feel your pain, Like stars that ache in midnight rain…”</p>
    <p>Because even when we were hurting — we were still holding on.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 6: My Periods Hit Today… And I Was Ready❤️</h3>
    <p>I remember her message: “My periods hit today…”</p>
    <p>I didn’t flinch. I didn’t panic.</p>
    <p>I said: “I’m ready. Bring on the cravings, the cuddles, the chaos. I’m here, sweetheart.”</p>
    <p>Because love isn’t just dates and roses — it’s being her safe place when she’s in pain.</p>
    <p>She laughed through her cramps that day. Not because it didn’t hurt…</p>
    <p>But because she had someone who stayed, without being asked.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 7: The Fight, The Tears, The Realization</h3>
    <p>We fought. I said something I didn’t mean. She cried. I cried harder.</p>
    <p>That day — I saw her tears and broke down.</p>
    <p>I thought, “Did I lose her?”</p>
    <p>But she held my hand through the phone and said:</p>
    <p>“Mistakes? They’ll happen. But leaving you? That’s never an option.”</p>
    <p>That’s the day I realized — love doesn’t mean being perfect. It means staying — even when it hurts.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 8: The Girl Who Made Me Feel Like a Kid Again❤️</h3>
    <p>She scolds me when I’m lazy. Makes me study when I’m distracted.</p>
    <p>She pampers me like a mom. Flirts with me like a lover.</p>
    <p>And me? I become a kid around her. Spoiled. Safe. Soft.</p>
    <p>She brings out the version of me I didn’t know existed — the silly, playful, carefree one who just wants her attention.</p>
    <p>Every “study now!” or “go sleep” is her way of saying: “I love you, you idiot.”</p>
    <p>And every time — I smile, and I fall a little more.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h3 class="chapter-title"> Chapter 9: The Story Beyond Screens❤️</h3>
    <p>We haven’t met. No dinner dates. No holding hands in a park.</p>
    <p>But what we have? It’s real. Raw. Rare.</p>
    <p>We turned video calls into hugs. Voice notes into lullabies.</p>
    <p>And distance? It only made our bond stronger.</p>
    <p>Even when we’re miles apart, I feel her beside me.</p>
    <p>Because love doesn’t always need proximity — it just needs persistence.</p>
    <p>“I’ll love you,” I said, “in every way I can. Through texts, through efforts, through storms. I’ll love you even when it’s hard.”</p>
    <p>And I meant it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h3 class="chapter-title">💍 Chapter 10: Our Forever❤️</h3>
    <p>We’ve come so far — from “Heyy” to “I can’t live without you.”</p>
    <p>We’ve faced fears, laughed through calls, cried through misunderstandings.</p>
    <p>And today, I say it without doubt — “I choose you. Not just today, but every day.”</p>
    <p>We aren’t perfect. But we’re real. And that’s enough.</p>
    <p>Let the world call it virtual. Let them say it won’t last.</p>
    <p>But we know the truth:</p>
    <p><strong>✨ This Is Us — A thousand poems, a million moments, and one forever. ❤️</strong></p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Algerian', cursive; color:#ad1457;"><strong>~ I LOVE YOU SOO MUCH MY PYAARA BACCHA ❤️</strong></p>
